Create serverless logic with Azure Functions
============================================
...by using Azure Portal
	Creating a FunctionApp from Azure Portal
	Create a function with Http trigger
	Edit the function's code to return a string containing the date and time
	Test the function with Http trigger from Azure Portal
	Get the connection key of the function from Azure Portal
	Test the function with Http trigger from Postman
	Test the function with Http trigger from cURL
	Check the logs from the monitoring dashboard
...by using Visual Studio
	Create an Azure Function in Visual Studio
	Test an Azure Function in local
	Get the publish profile of the Azure Function from Azure Portal
	Publish an Azure Function from Visual Studio

Execute an Azure Function with triggers
=======================================
…by using data operations
	Create a Queue storage
	Create a function with Queue storage trigger from Visual Studio
	Test the function with Queue storage trigger from Visual Studio

	Create a function with Queue storage trigger
 from Azure Portal

Chain Azure functions together using input and output bindings
==============================================================
Read data with input bindings
	...from a Http trigger
	...from a Queue trigger
	...from a Blob trigger
	...from a Timer trigger
Write data with output bindings
	...by sending an Http response
	...by creating an item to a Queue storage
	...by creating a file to a Blob storage
	...by sending a mail
Chain Azure functions together
	Create a function with an Http trigger and a Queue storage output
	Create a function with a Queue trigger and a Blob storage output
	Create a function with a Blob trigger and a mail output
	Test the chain
Design and implement a custom binding

Azure Durable Functions
=======================
Simplify the Chaining pattern
	Create a simple orchestration of three functions
	Create a sub-orchestration of two functions and add replace the second function in the previous orchestration
	Testing and monitoring an orchestration
	Logging with replays
	Handling errors, retries, cancellation
Implement a Fan-in / fan-out pattern
Handling human interaction in an orchestration
Coordinate the state of long-running operations with the Async HTTP APIs pattern
Replace a timer trigger with the Monitoring pattern
Dealing with breaking changes when deploying a new version
	Do nothing
	Stop all in-flight instances by clearing the contents of the internal control-queue and workitem-queue queues
	Side-by-side deployments with deployment slots and the Task Hub
